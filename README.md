Multi-character hack'n'slash dungeon crawler, a la Rusty Hearts (but
non-sucky).

# Characters

Characters are analogues to badass Biblical characters, but probably nothing
more than that.  Think *Once Upon a Time* real world.

* Sam (Sampson) - Female close-range warrior-type.  Wields jawbone and flings
  long flowy hair everywhere.
* Dave (David) - Ranged attacker.  Sling.
* Mo (Moses) - DPS caster.  Painful sores, instant darkness, hordes of insects,
  etc.
* Eli (Elisha) - Minion master.  Sends bears to tank and beat up on annoying
  teenagers.
* Jay/Chris/Jess/Kris? (Jesus/Christ) - Healer.  Short-range teleportation
  abilities for getting away from crowds of mobs (like a Guild Wars A/Mo).
